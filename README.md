## Twitter Lab: 

1. Setting up Realtime Database in `Firebase`:
    1. Go to your console and choose your project.
    2. Go to Realtime Database and create a database.
    3. Go to rules and change false to true.
    4. Make sure to copy the database's link. V

2. Setting up Realtime Database in `app.py`:
    1. In the config dictionary add databaseURL as a key and the link you copied as the value.
    2. Intialize the 'db' using the firebase object. V


3. Add in `signup.html` 3 inputs: V
    1. `full_name`
    2. `username`
    3. `bio` - It should take a maximum of 280 letters.


4. When the user signs up: V
    - Create a dictionary called user that contains the inputs' name as keys and and the inputs as values.
    - Add the user to the `database` through the child `Users` adding him through his uid (retrieve it through login_session). 


5. Create a form in `add_tweet.html` to add a tweet to the database: V
    - The form should contain:
        - `Title`.
        - `Text`- It should take a maximum of 280 letters.
        - **Don't forget to add action and method**


6. When the user submits a tweet:
    - Create a dictionary called `tweet` that contains the inputs' name as keys and the inputs as values.
    - In the dictionary add a key named `uid` and the value as the uid of the user that wrote the tweet.
    - Add the tweet using the child `Tweets` to the `database` with a random key (the push method).

        
7. Create an html page called tweets.html & a route called `/all_tweets`:
    - in this html page display all the tweets that were written:
        - Go to the child `Tweets` and use get().val()
